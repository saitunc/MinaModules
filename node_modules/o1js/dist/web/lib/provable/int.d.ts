     * Bitwise AND gadget on {@link UInt32} elements. Equivalent to the [bitwise AND `&` operator in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_AND).
     * The AND gate works by comparing two bits and returning `1` if both bits are `1`, and `0` otherwise.
     *
     * It can be checked by a double generic gate that verifies the following relationship between the values below.
     *
     * The generic gate verifies:\
     * `a + b = sum` and the conjunction equation `2 * and = sum - xor`\
     * Where:\
     * `a + b = sum`\
     * `a ^ b = xor`\
     * `a & b = and`
     *
     * You can find more details about the implementation in the [Mina book](https://o1-labs.github.io/proof-systems/specs/kimchi.html?highlight=gates#and)
     *
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * let a = UInt32.from(3);    // ... 000011
     * let b = UInt32.from(5);    // ... 000101
     *
     * let c = a.and(b, 2);    // ... 000001
