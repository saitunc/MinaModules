/**
 * `Packed<T>` is a "packed" representation of any type `T`.
 *
 * "Packed" means that field elements which take up fewer than 254 bits are packed together into
 * as few field elements as possible.
 *
 * For example, you can pack several Bools (1 bit) or UInt32s (32 bits) into a single field element.
 *
 * Using a packed representation can make sense in provable code where the number of constraints
 * depends on the number of field elements per value.
 *
 * For example, `Provable.if(bool, x, y)` takes O(n) constraints, where n is the number of field
 * elements in x and y.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // define a packed type from a type
 * let PackedType = Packed.create(MyType);
 *
 * // pack a value
 * let packed = PackedType.pack(value);
 *
 * // ... operations on packed values, more efficient than on plain values ...
 *
 * // unpack a value
 * let value = packed.unpack();
 * ```
 *
 * **Warning**: Packing only makes sense where packing actually reduces the number of field elements.
 * For example, it doesn't make sense to pack a _single_ Bool, because it will be 1 field element before
 * and after packing. On the other hand, it does makes sense to pack a type that holds 10 or 20 Bools.

/**
 * `Hashed<T>` represents a type `T` by its hash.
 *
 * Since a hash is only a single field element, this can be more efficient in provable code

 *
 * For example, `Provable.if(bool, x, y)` takes O(n) constraints, where n is the number of field
 * elements in x and y. With Hashed, this is reduced to O(1).
 *
 * The downside is that you will pay the overhead of hashing your values, so it helps to experiment
 * in which parts of your code a hashed representation is beneficial.

 * Usage:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // define a hashed type from a type
