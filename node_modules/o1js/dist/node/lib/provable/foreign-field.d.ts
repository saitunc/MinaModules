 * Create a class representing a prime order finite field, which is different from the native {@link Field}.

 *
 * `createForeignField(p)` takes the prime modulus `p` of the finite field as input, as a bigint.
 * We support prime moduli up to a size of 259 bits.
 *
 * The returned {@link ForeignField} class supports arithmetic modulo `p` (addition and multiplication),
 * as well as helper methods like `assertEquals()` and `equals()`.
 *
 * _Advanced details:_
 *
 * Internally, a foreign field element is represented as three native field elements, each of which
 * represents a limb of 88 bits. Therefore, being a valid foreign field element means that all 3 limbs
 * fit in 88 bits, and the foreign field element altogether is smaller than the modulus p.
 *
 * Since the full `x < p` check is expensive, by default we only prove a weaker assertion, `x < 2^ceil(log2(p))`,
 * see {@link ForeignField.assertAlmostReduced} for more details.
 *
 * This weaker assumption is what we call "almost reduced", and it is represented by the {@link AlmostForeignField} class.
 * Note that only {@link AlmostForeignField} supports multiplication and inversion, while {@link UnreducedForeignField}
 * only supports addition and subtraction.
 *
 * This function returns the `Unreduced` class, which will cause the minimum amount of range checks to be created by default.
 * If you want to do multiplication, you have two options:
 * - create your field elements using the {@link ForeignField.AlmostReduced} constructor, or using the `.provable` type on that class.
 * ```ts
 * let x = Provable.witness(ForeignField.AlmostReduced.provable, () => ForeignField.from(5));
 * ```
 * - create your field elements normally and convert them using `x.assertAlmostReduced()`.
 * ```ts
 * let xChecked = x.assertAlmostReduced(); // asserts x < 2^ceil(log2(p)); returns `AlmostForeignField`
 * ```
 *
 * Similarly, there is a separate class {@link CanonicalForeignField} which represents fully reduced, "canonical" field elements.
 * To convert to a canonical field element, use {@link ForeignField.assertCanonical}:
 *
 * ```ts
 * x.assertCanonical(); // asserts x < p; returns `CanonicalForeignField`
 * ```
 * You will likely not need canonical fields most of the time.
 *
 * Base types for all of these classes are separately exported as {@link UnreducedForeignField}, {@link AlmostForeignField} and {@link CanonicalForeignField}.,
 *
 * @param modulus the modulus of the finite field you are instantiating
