/**
 * A {@link Field} is an element of a prime order [finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field).
 * Every other provable type is built using the {@link Field} type.
 *
 * The field is the [pasta base field](https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/) of order 2^254 + 0x224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001 ({@link Field.ORDER}).
 *
 * You can create a new Field from everything "field-like" (`bigint`, integer `number`, decimal `string`, `Field`).
 * @example
 * ```
 * Field(10n); // Field construction from a big integer
 * Field(100); // Field construction from a number
 * Field("1"); // Field construction from a decimal string
 * ```
 *
 * **Beware**: Fields _cannot_ be constructed from fractional numbers or alphanumeric strings:
 * ```ts
 * Field(3.141); // ERROR: Cannot convert a float to a field element
 * Field("abc"); // ERROR: Invalid argument "abc"
 * ```
 *
 * Creating a Field from a negative number can result in unexpected behavior if you are not familiar with [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).
 * @example
 * ```
 * const x = Field(-1); // Valid Field construction from negative number
 * const y = Field(Field.ORDER - 1n); // equivalent to `x`
 * ```
 *
 * **Important**: All the functions defined on a Field (arithmetic, logic, etc.) take their arguments as "field-like". A Field itself is also defined as a "field-like" element.
 *
 * @param value - the value to convert to a {@link Field}
 *
 * @return A {@link Field} with the value converted from the argument
